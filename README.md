# blode
blode is a simple Node.js application to create static blogs. I've designed it to create my own blog ([zanon.io](http://zanon.io)) and I'll be glad to help if you want to use it too.

## Quick Start

```
> npm install static-blode -g
> blode new my-blog-folder
> cd my-blog-folder
> blode build
> blode deploy
```

## How does it work?

The Node.js application reads the blog posts written with the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax and compile them to HTML. It also minifies CSS, JS, pre-render pages to improve SEO and gzip contents before uploading to Amazon S3. If you don't want to host on AWS, you can deploy manually to another service.

## Why a static site generator and not Wordpress?
You can use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [another](http://www.sitepoint.com/6-static-blog-generators-arent-jekyll/) static website generator, but please, don't use Wordpress for blogging! Static websites don't need a dedicated server neither a database. A serverless blog means an extremely fast and cheap website. Also, you don't need to worry about security and server updates. You can read more reasons [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/wordpress-vs-jekyll-might-want-make-switch/).

## Features

- Compiles Markdown files to HTML
- Uses single-page application with AngularJS
- Pre-render pages
- Adds blog posts filters by tags
- Minifies CSS/JS
- gzip and upload to Amazon S3
- Updates the RSS and sitemap files

## Installing

```
> npm install static-blode -g
```

## How to use

Below follows some instructions about how to use blode. If you have any doubt, please, file an issue and I'll try to help you.

### Create a sample blog

The first step is to generate the blog sample files:
```
> blode new my-blog-folder
> cd my-blog-folder
```

### Build files

The following command will render all markdown files, update the sitemap, RSS and update additional files for Angular.
```
> blode build
```

### Configuration

If you want to deploy your blog on Amazon S3, you need to modify the config.json file that is located at the root level of your blog folder. Fill the following properties:

```json
{
  "awsAccessKeyId" : "your_access_key",
  "awsSecretAccessKey" : "your_secret_key",
  "awsRegion": "your_region",
  "awsBucketName" : "your_aws_bucket_name"
}
```

The only mandatory option is the **awsBucketName** (that must match your domain name). The rest of the settings can be configured with shared files or environment variables (more [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/guide/node-configuring.html)).

For a tutorial on how to host a static blog in Amazon S3, you can read [here](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/gettingstarted/latest/swh/website-hosting-intro.html).

### Deploy

Deploy is done to AWS S3 using:
```
> blode deploy
```

## Blog posts

Blog posts should be created inside the **raw** folder using the [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language and you can use your favorite editor for this. If you don't have one, I suggest: [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io)

blode requires that each post uses the following format:  

<pre>
<code>
Title: < Post Title >  
Summary: < Summary of post. >  
Tags: < TagX >  
Date: < NOV 15, 2015 >  
URL: < post-url >  

< ##  Post Title  >  

< Here starts the content of your Post >  
</code>
</pre>

**Note:** replace &lt; text &gt; by your data.
