# blode
blode is a simple Node.js application to create static websites. I've designed it for fun and to create my own blog. You can see the result here: [zanon.io](http://zanon.io).

The Node.js application reads the blog posts written with the [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax and compile them to HTML. Since its a SPA made with Angular, blode also pre-render the pages to improve SEO. For deployment, the content is gzipped and uploaded to Amazon S3.

## Why a static site generator and not Wordpress?
You can use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [another](http://www.sitepoint.com/6-static-blog-generators-arent-jekyll/) static website generator, but please, don't use Wordpress for blogging! Static websites doesn't need a dedicated server neither a database. A serverless blog means an extremely fast and cheap website. Also, you don't need to worry about security and server updates. You can read more reasons [here](http://www.sitepoint.com/wordpress-vs-jekyll-might-want-make-switch/).

## Features

## Installing

// TODO: not deployed yet to NPM

## How to use

Below follows some instructions about how to use blode. If you have any doubt, please, file an issue and I'll try to help you.

The first step, is to generate the boilerplate blog:
```
> blode boilerplate
```

After creating new posts, adding markdown files inside the raw folder, build the blog with:
```
> blode build
```

If you have configured a AWS account, you can deploy the blog directly to S3:
```
> blode deploy
```

## Configuration

You need to modify the config.json file the is located at root level of your blog. Fill the following properties:

```json
{
  "directory" : "your_directory",
  "awsAccessKeyId" : "your_access_key",
  "awsSecretAccessKey" : "your_secret_key",
  "awsBucketName" : "your_aws_bucket_name"
}
```

## Blog posts

Blog posts should be created using the [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) markup language and you can use your favorite editor to this. If you don't have one, I suggest: [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io)

blode requires that each post uses the following format:  

<pre>
<code>
Title: {{ Post Title }}  
Summary: {{ Summary of post. }}  
Tags: {{ TagX }}  
Date: {{ NOV 15, 2015 }}  
URL: {{ post-url }}  
       
## {{ Post Title  }}  
    
{{ Here starts the content of your Post }}  
</code>
</pre>

**Note:** replace {{ text }} by your data.
